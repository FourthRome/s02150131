# OnnxImageRecognition

### Installation

After cloning the repo to your machine, download the latest MNIST ONNX model:

https://github.com/onnx/models/blob/master/vision/classification/mnist/model/mnist-8.onnx

Currently recognition program has support only for this specific filename, "mnist-8.onnx", but it's to be changed soon.

Put the downloaded model into the ImageRecognizer directory, and you're ready to go.

### Testing

The repository contains the "samples" folder with proper digit images; you can use this folder's absolute local path to test the program.
